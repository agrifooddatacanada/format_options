# Format Options
A collection of RegEx codes and associated English descriptions when adding data format overlays to OCA schemas.

# OCA and the format overlay

In Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA) the format for correct data is expressed in RegEx (regular expressions). Within [OCA Composer](https://www.semanticengine.org), which helps users write OCA schemas with a friendly user interface, users can add format codes to their schemas from drop-down lists. The contents of those list are generated from the appropriate format code .csv files listed in this repository.
